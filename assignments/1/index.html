  <h1>Assignment 1</h1>
  <p>
    The goal of assignment one was to show knowledge af <em>html</em>, below
    as a brief explanation of how this page was created.
  <hr>
  <ul>
    <li>
        <h5>The style of the page.</h5>
        Instead of creating a <code>&ltstyle&gt</code> tag in the head of the page,
        I opted to create a separate stylesheet, this has the benefit that it's
        easier to reuse since it only takes the following line to add it to each
        page.<br>
        <code>&ltlink rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../../style.css"&gt</code><br>
        The style sheet contains selected pieces of code from the <a href="https://github.com/jasonm23/markdown-css-themes/blob/gh-pages/foghorn.css">
        foghorn.css</a> sheet.
    <li>
        Below is an image of a table that contains Anscombe's quartet, which is
        a set of four datasets that has the same variance and mean.
        <img src="table.png" />
    </li>
    <li>
        The data in Anscombe's quartet although similar <strong id="num">is not the same
        data sets</strong>

        As seen in the image above
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>An example of two interactive visualization</h2>
  <ol>
      <li><a href="http://scaleofuniverse.com">Scale of the universe</a>
      <p>The site shows just how much size differs in the universe, on one
          extreme we have the <em>planck length</em> which has a size of $10^{-35}$ meters,
          and on the other side of the spectrum we have the estimated size of the universe
          which has a size of $10^{27}$ meters. This massive interval can be hard
          to understand and we easily dismiss the difference between $10^{-15}$
          and $10^{-10}$ since we are presented with so much information.

          By having a scroll bar at the bottom we see just how big the difference
          in size is between for instance a helium atom and a proton.

          The visualization has pleasing aesthetics, my biggest problem with it
          is that it plays music. This should not be on by default since it
          draws attention away from the visualization and is bad UX.</p> </li>

      <li><a href="https://www.gapminder.org/tools/#_chart-type=bubbles">Gapminder</a>
        <p>This visualization is made by Gapminder which was founded by Hans Rosling.
          This is a very advanced visualization that allows the user to quickly
          get an overview of the data and see that the larger incomes means a
          longer life expectancy. The use of colors show a grouping by continent
          and a user can hover their mouse over a circle to get the exact country.

          The most powerfull feature of the visualization is the play button
          in the lower left corner, it plays the animation over time and tells
          a story with the data, showing for instance how the second world war
          affected the income and life expectancy per country.
        </p>
      </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>My interactive visualization</h2>
    By the end of this course i would like to be able to visualize connections
    between objects. This could be realtions in a database, dependencies between
    different software libraries, etc. A similar visualization is the <em><a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/facebook/"></a>
    wolfram alpha facebook report</em>
    <img src="wolfram.png">
    It creates a network of ones facebook friends and shows which group of
    friends exists.

    The visualization of software dependencies is aimed at developers and
    shows them how each library has evolved over time, a software project like
    <em>node.js</em> would most likely start out with very few connections and
    over time aggregate a lot more connections. Indicating that it is an
    active framework. It would also be expected that there would be a lot of
    one to many connections and these would appear and disappear frequently.
