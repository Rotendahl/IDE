  <h1>Assignment 2</h1>
  <p>
    The goal of assignment one was to build two visualizations of a temperature
    dataset for Copenhagen the raw data can be found <a href="http://data.giss.nasa.gov/tmp/gistemp/STATIONS/tmp_612061860000_14_0/station.txt">
    here</a>.

    <h2>Motivation and method</h2>
    <p>The goal of the two visualizations above is to show how the weather has
    changed over the past 100 years.

    The process of creating these visualization began with importing them into
    excel and playing with the numbers. I then decided that the best way
    to show how it changed was to take the average of each quarter and plot them
    by year. The idea was to minimize outliers and show a more general trend.
    </p>
    <p>The Data is from Copenhagen</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>The Bar chart:</strong>
        <p>
        The bar chart was written from scratch
        by me. The chart does not contain any numbers since the goal is to
        show the change and not the actual temperature. For each quarter the
        size of the bars are normalized, i.e a bar with size 100 in quarter one
        has a different temperature than a bar with the same size in quarter two.
        </p>

        <p>
        If the temperature hadn't changed over the last 100 years the bars would
        all be roughly the same size. A good example of this is the 2. quarter,
        the bars all have about the same size except two outliers, which means
        that the temperature has remained somewhat constant.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is not the case for the first quarter where it's easy to see that
          recent years have bin much warmer than a 100 years ago. Since the
          rest of the quarters have bin more stable this fact is not present in
          the yearly view
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h4>Improvements:</h4>
          Had I bin more experienced in D3 I would have added a variable scale
          that adjusted to the temperature for the different quarters and
          display it with numbers. I would also have made it such that one would
          not have to reload the page before clicking on a quarter.
      </li>

      <li><strong>The Line plot</strong>This line plot uses code from this <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3883245">
      site</a>
      This plot shows the general rising trend per year, it's very small but
      it's there.  
    </li>

      <li><strong>Dynamic Elements</strong> The bar chart could be improved
      by interactivity, here are some ideas that could improve it
      <ol>
          <li><strong>Animating the bars:</strong> When one opened the page
          all bars should have the same size, when a quarter was clicked it should
          animate the scaling proces.
          <br>
          This would emphasize the difference between the quarters since one
          would see little differnce between Q2, Q3 and Q4 but Q1 would take
          more time to scale and move the center line to add even more focus to it
          </li>
          <br>
          <li><strong>Mouse over events:</strong> If one where to mouse over the
            buttons it could overlay that quarter to the one currently selected
            and highlight the difference to show the trend for each year.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li><strong>Time slider:</strong> A slider that added data for one
            more year and normalized the data again.
          </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    </ul>
