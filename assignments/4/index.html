    Below we have made a visualization of a dataset consisting of outlines of
    hands. The dataset has 40 hands with 112 dimensions, that is 56 points with
    an x- and y-coordinate. In the left graph you can see the outline of a one
    of the hands. This is pretty cool in itself, but want we want to showcase if
    is the utility of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). <br>
    PCA is a statistical method which
    reduces a dataset to fewer dimensions and orders the dimensions from most
    significant to least significant. For our visualization we have reduced the
    number of dimensions from 112 to 40. As we know the two first dimensions 
    are the most significant we can plot these and expect it to be meaningful.
    This is the rightmost plot. <br>
    In this plot you can hover over the individual points and see the values of
    the pair and which hand number it is. If you click a point the matching hand
    will be drawn in the left plot. Now the interesting thing is what these
    coordinates says about the hand. Remember that we have reduced a hand
    consisting of 112 coordinates to just 2 coordinates. <br>
    If you select the rightmost points the fingers of the corresponding hands
    are pretty close to each other and are pointing straight left. Conversely
    the hands on the left side of the graph are spread. If we look at the lone
    point in the bottom right, its lower fingers are tight together while the
    other fingers are far apart. The hand at the top of the graph have the top
    right fingers close together while the bottom two are spread. In the middle
    of the graph the fingers are in similar positions. <br>
    So to sum it up. We have used PCA to reduce our dataset to just two
    points per hands, these coordinates have no intrinsic meaning and yet when
    we plot the initial dataset we see that we can make a good guess at the look
    of the matching hands based on the value of our two principal components.

        The goal of assignment one was to build two visualizations of a temperature
        dataset for Copenhagen the raw data can be found <a href="http://data.giss.nasa.gov/tmp/gistemp/STATIONS/tmp_612061860000_14_0/station.txt">
