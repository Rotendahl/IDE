    <p>
      Below we have made a visualization of a dataset consisting of outlines of
      hands. The dataset has 40 hands each with 112 dimensions, that is 56
      points with an x- and y-coordinate. In the left graph you can see the
      outline of a one of the hands. This is pretty cool in itself, but want we
      want to showcase is the utility of Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

    PCA is a statistical method which reduces a dataset to fewer dimensions and
    orders the dimensions from most significant to least significant in terms of
    data variance. For our visualization we have reduced the number of
    dimensions from 112 to 40. As we know the two first dimensions are the most
    significant, we can plot these and expect it to be meaningful.
    This is the rightmost plot. In this plot you can hover over the individual
    points and see the values of the pair and which hand number it is. If you
    click a point the matching hand will be drawn in the left plot.
  </p>

  <p>
    The interesting thing is what these coordinates says about the hand.
    Remember that we have reduced a hand consisting of 112 coordinates to just 2
    coordinates. If you select the <span style="text-decoration:underline;"
    id="rightPoint">rightmost points</span> the fingers of the corresponding
    hands are pretty close to each other and are pointing straight left. <br>
    Conversely the hands on <span style="text-decoration:underline;"
    id="leftPoint">the left side of the graph</span> are spread. If we look at
    the <span style="text-decoration:underline" id="lowleft">lone point in the
    bottom left</span>, its lower fingers are tight together while the
    other fingers are far apart. The hand at
    <span style="text-decoration:underline" id="top"> the top of the graph
    </span>have the top
    right fingers close together while the bottom two are spread. <span
    style="text-decoration:underline" id="mid">In the middle of the graph</span>
    the fingers are in similar positions. <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    So to sum it up. We have used PCA to reduce our dataset to just two
    points per hands, these coordinates have no intrinsic meaning and yet when
    we plot the initial dataset we see that we can make a good guess at the look
    of the matching hands based on the value of our two principal components.
