The population in a country is rarely steady. As opportunities arise in the
cities and the countryside offers fewer jobs it is common for people to move
towards the cities. In Denmark anno 1801 almost 80 % of the population lived in
the countryside but in 2004 more than 85 % were found in cities. This is a
massive shift over 200 years. What we want to show is that the population have
not stabilized. People are still moving and small towns are suffering from
business closing and jobs moving away. In recent years we have seen attempts
at revitalizing "udkantsdanmark" (outer Denmark) by moving government jobs away
from Copenhagen. We have made a visualization of the population movement in
recent years.

The map allows you to choose two years and see the percentage difference
in population accross Danish muncipialities. A dark blue indicates a large
decrease in population and red is a large increase. 

We opted for percentage difference instead of the actual difference
or exact population firstly because the muncipialities vary greatly in size
and secondly because larger populations see larger growth in numbers without
people moving. If we had population densities we could show some changes in
this, but it would not be showing the urbanization.
